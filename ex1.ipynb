    "## Exercise 1. Provide a histogram of word repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to design the map and reduce functions to provide a histogram of word repetitions in one or multiple text documents. That is, the number of words that are repeated once, the number of words that are repeated twice, the number of words that are repeated three times, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: A document or multiple documents, containing plain text. You can assume that each line (or document) is given a random ID that will be used as input key for the map phase, and the input values are the lines of text or entire documents. So the input may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (1, Welcome to the World)\n",
    "    (2, of Big Big Data)\n",
    "    (3, Welcome World Bye)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: Your output should say how many words repeat 1, 2, etc. times, where the number of times is given as output key, and the total number of words repetitions as the value (i.e. `(number of repetitions, number of words)`). Thus, for the above input, the output should be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (1 time - 5 words)\n",
    "    (2 times - 3 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You can concatenate as many MapReduce processes as you like, so for example you could first apply the solution for the Word Count and take that as input for the a second stage."
